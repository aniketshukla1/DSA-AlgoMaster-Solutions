# AlgoMaster.io Solutions in Python

This repository contains **Python solutions** for all problems covered on [AlgoMaster.io](https://algomaster.io), organized for easy reference and learning. Each solution is written with clarity and includes comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.

**More language support (e.g., Java, C++, JavaScript, Golang) will be added soon**, making this repository a one-stop solution for AlgoMaster.io problems in multiple languages.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Solutions for all AlgoMaster.io problem categories.
- **Well-Commented Code**: Every solution includes a detailed explanation of the approach.
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Focus on clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.
- **Future Expansion**: Planned support for solutions in other languages like Java, C++, and JavaScript.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on problem categories:

- ðŸ“¦ **AlgoMaster.io Solutions**
  - **Arrays**


Each problem is organized into its own folder within the relevant category, making finding and reviewing solutions easy.

## ðŸ›  How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aniketshukla1/DSA-AlgoMaster-Solutions.git
   ```
2.	Navigate to the category and problem folder youâ€™re interested in:
     ```bash
     cd Arrays/Move Zeroes/
     ```
3.  Open the Solution.py file to view the solution:
     ```bash
     cat Solution.py
     ```

ðŸ“– Solution Format

Each solution file follows a consistent format:
	â€¢	Problem Name: Title of the problem.
	â€¢	Problem Description: A short summary of the problem.
	â€¢	Approach: Explanation of the solution approach.
	â€¢	Complexity: Analysis of time and space complexity.
	â€¢	Code: Optimized Python solution.

ðŸ§© Example

File: Solution.py

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        non_zero_element = 0
        for idx, _ in enumerate(len(nums)):
            if nums[idx] != 0:
                nums[non_zero_element] = nums[idx]
                non_zero_element += 1

        for i in range(non_zero_element, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0
```
